While loop:
    They help us repeat code.

Why we should use while loops?
    because manually copying and pasting is very bad and it's not scalable.
    They also help us reduce the number of limes of code that we have to type.

Syntax WhileLoop:
    While (condition){
    code that we want to repeat
    }
