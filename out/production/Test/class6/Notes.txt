Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
    work with boolean (true, False) values. there are three logical operators
    1) !, ||, &&

Why we should use Logical Operators:
    1) they can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us to reduce the lines of code that we have to write.

NOT (!):
    it reverse the conditions. If something is true it will make it false
    and if something is false it will make it true.
    System.out.println(!true) => false

Logical OR Operators (||):
    it can combine two or more conditions and returns true as long
    as there is one condition is true. If all the conditions be come
    false it returns us false.

Logical AND (&&):
    it can also combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all
    the conditions are true.
