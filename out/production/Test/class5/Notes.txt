Scanner class:
Helps use the input from keyboard.
Logical Operators:
    just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
    there are 3 logical operators: 1)! - not    2)|| - or    3)&& - and

Why should we learn about the logical operators?
    we can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators.


What is the syntax:
    they only work with boolean data type
    if (! condition)                   not
    if (condition1 || condition2)      or
    if (condition1 && condition2)      and
Not operators (!)
    not is used to negate the boolean values if something is true it will make it false,
    and if something is false it will make it true.

What is a SwitchCase statement:
    Switch case statements are just another of achieving the same result
    as if-else-if conditions.

Why should we learn about them:
    it's very fast.
Syntax:

String var:
    switch(var){
    case 1:
    sout "1"
    break;
    case 2:
    {output}
    break;
    default:
    {otherwise output}
    }

Rules that we should follow:
    1) we can only use byte, short, int, char, String in switch case statement.
    2) we can not use relational operators in switch case statement are also not allowed.
    3) we cannot use logical operators
