Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations,
    subtractions we can compare things if two entities are same or not,
    if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are 3 main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators,
    Relational operators and logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:
    we use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like
    subtraction etc.
    + => Addition
    - => Subtraction
    / => Division
    * => multiplication
    % => modulus , remainder

Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities.
    for example if something is bigger than other thing or if two numbers
    are same or not, or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
    == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we gat false.
    != => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
    >  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not, if greater we get a true.
    <  => opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a true.
    >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true.
    <= => opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.

Conditional constructs:
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition
if condition is true that java execute the code otherwise it skips that cod.
How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code even another if condition

    if(){
    }
    }
    }


Important Notes:
1) for String we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive data type
2) we can cmd+opt+l (for Mac), ctrl+alt+l (for windows) to format our code.
3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

If else conditions
    When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use 'If else if'.
    When we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions.
