Arrays in Java:
    Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use indexes
    to get back the values.

Why we should learn Arrays?
    If we have to store a lot of values it becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
Syntax of Arrays:
    We can create arrays in two different ways:
    1) Datatype [] arr = {element 1, element 2, element3,...};
         System.out.println(arr[0]);

    2) Datatype [] arr = new Datatype [Size]

Note:
    Other than a loop we also can ue below syntax:
    int [] arr={10,13,20,25,45,50};
    // Bellow code prints all the elements from an array without a loop
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
